## Chip Design \(ASIC/FPGA/SoC\)

### FPGA

- [FPGA Design Elements](https://github.com/laforest/FPGADesignElements) - A self-contained online book containing a library of FPGA design modules and related coding/design guides.
- [Blinky on every FPGA](https://github.com/fusesoc/blinky)
- [SoC Builder from LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) - LiteX is a MiSoC-based SoC builder using Migen as Python DSL that can be used to create SoCs and full FPGA designs.

### Analog Design

- [The Designer's GuideÂ® Community](https://designers-guide.org/) Analog, mixed-signal and RF circuit designers come to learn about simulation, modeling and design.
- [Using gm/Id methodology](https://eesurgeon.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/using-the-gmid-methodology-in-analog-circuit-design/)

### Digital Design

### Open Source Implementations

#### Open Core Collections

- [OpenCores](https://opencores.org/) - OpenCores is the most prominent online community for the development of gateware IP (Intellectual Properties) Cores.
- [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/) - A "LibreCore" is such an IP core that is created and distributed in the open source spirit.
- [OpenTitan](https://github.com/lowrisc/opentitan) - OpenTitan will make the silicon RoT design and implementation more transparent, trustworthy, and secure for enterprises, platform providers, and chip manufacturers.

#### Elements

- [Basic Common SV Modules](https://github.com/taichi-ishitani/tbcm) - FIFO, onehot, round robin Arbiter etc.
- [Ethernet 1G/100M/10M Core](https://github.com/lewiz-support/LMAC_CORE1) - Open source Ethernet Core 1
- [Asynchronous FIFO](https://github.com/damofthemoon/async_fifo) - A dual clock asynchronous FIFO written in verilog, tested with Icarus Verilog
- [CDC Modules](https://github.com/damofthemoon/cdc) - This repository gathers several basic modules to handle CDC in a design
