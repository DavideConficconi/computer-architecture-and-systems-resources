## Resources

- [Constantly updated thread on developments in memory by Ogawa on twitter](https://twitter.com/ogawa_tter/status/1341217903236923392)

### Projects

- [HSE: Heterogeneous-Memory Storage Engine](https://github.com/hse-project/hse) - HSE is an embeddable key-value store designed for SSDs based on NAND flash or persistent memory. HSE optimizes performance and endurance by orchestrating data placement across DRAM and multiple classes of SSDs or other solid-state storage.

## Persistent Memory

- [Persistent Memory Programming](https://pmem.io/) - Persistent memory is used in conjunction with memory and storage.
- [Persistent Memory](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html) - Intel DC Optane technology
