# Interconnects

Everything about:
- On-chip communication
- Inter-chip communication
- Computer Networks

## Chip-level communication

- [Compute Express Link aka CXL](https://www.computeexpresslink.org/) Compute Express Link (CXL) is a new breakthrough high-speed CPU interconnect that enables a high-speed, efficient performance between the CPU and platform enhancements and workload accelerators.

### OpenSource Implementations

#### On-Chip

- [Wishbone Interconnect](https://github.com/fossi-foundation/wishbone) - A well-documented, popular open source standard compatible with most open-source IP.
- [WishBone to AXI](https://github.com/ZipCPU/wb2axip) - A Pipelined Wishbone B4 to AXI4 bridge
- [AXI Stream Components](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axis) - Collection of AXI Stream bus components. Most components are fully parametrizable in interface widths.
- [AXI Components](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-axi) - Verilog AXI components for FPGA implementation
- [AXI4](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi) - AXI4 and AXI4-Lite interface definitions and testbench utilities
- 

#### Inter-chip
- [Ethernet Components](https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-ethernet) - Collection of Ethernet-related components for gigabit, 10G, and 25G packet processing (8 bit and 64 bit datapaths).
