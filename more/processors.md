Everything about processors

## Open-source digital design implementations of Processors

- [ZipCPU](https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu) - A small, light weight, RISC CPU soft core
- [Microwatt](https://github.com/antonblanchard/microwatt/) - A tiny Open POWER ISA softcore written in VHDL for FPGAs


### RISCV based

- [PicoRV32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) - A Size-Optimized RISC-V CPU
- [Vectorblox ORCA](https://github.com/VectorBlox/orca) - ORCA is an implementation of RISC-V. It is intended to target FPGAs and can be configured as either RV32I a RV32IM core.
- [Pulpino](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino) - PULPino is an open-source single-core microcontroller system, based on 32-bit RISC-V cores developed at ETH Zurich. PULPino is configurable to use either the RISCY or the zero-riscy core.
- [Icicle](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/icicle) - Icicle is a 32-bit RISC-V system on chip for iCE40 HX8K, iCE40 UP5K and ECP5 FPGAs. It can be built with the open-source SymbiFlow toolchain and currently targets several development boards.
- [RISCV-BOOM](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom) - The Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) is a synthesizable and parameterizable open source RV64GC RISC-V core written in the Chisel hardware construction language.
- [Piccolo](https://github.com/bluespec/Piccolo) - Open-source RISC-V CPUs from Bluespec
- [RI5CY](https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv) - RISCY is an in-order 4-stage RISC-V RV32IMFCXpulp CPU
- [VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) - FPGA-friendly RISC-V implementation written in SpinalHDL
- [darkriscv](https://github.com/darklife/darkriscv) - opensouce RISC-V implemented from scratch in one night!
- [SiFive Freedom](https://github.com/sifive/freedom)
- [Ariane](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) - Ariane is a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. It fully implements I, M, A and C extensions


## Interesting resources
- [sandsifter](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/sandsifter) - The sandsifter audits x86 processors for hidden instructions and hardware bugs, by systematically generating machine code to search through a processor's instruction set, and monitoring execution for anomalies.
